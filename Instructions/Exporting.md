# Exporting Data from OpenRefine
Once you have finished working with a data set in OpenRefine you may wish to export it. The export options are accessed through the 'Export' button at the top right of the OpenRefine interface

Export formats support include HTML, Excel and comma- and tab-separated value (csv and tsv). You can also write a custom export, selecting to export specific fields, adding a header or footer and specifying the exact format.

See here for a good template example for exporting to MODS/XML: http://digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca//content/blogs/converting-spreadsheets-modsxml-using-open-refine
