NOTE: This repository is a fork of a similar workshop that is being reworked for the SHARE Metadata workshop. Do not consider anything here ready or done for participants until I've removed this warning.

**Note to Participants**: Please have the latest release candidate of OpenRefine installed before the start of the workshop. Instructions for installation are available at [Installation](Installation/README.md). If you run into any issues with installation, please get in touch with [me](mailto:cmharlow@stanford.edu) as soon as you are able, and I'll work through these issues with you.

## Working with Examples
By the end, we won't have *perfect* or *complete* remediated metadata files, but we'll know how to get there and have started on this work. I will have metadata taken from the SHARE API to work with, but also invite participants to bring their own metadata files or datasets to work on.
