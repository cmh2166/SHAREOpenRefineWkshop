NOTE: This repository is a fork of a similar workshop that is being reworked for the SHARE Metadata workshop. Do not consider anything here ready or done for participants until I've removed this warning.

**Note to Participants**: Please have the latest release candidate of OpenRefine installed before the start of the workshop. Instructions for installation are available at [Installation](Installation/README.md). If you run into any issues with installation, please get in touch with [me](mailto:cmharlow@stanford.edu) as soon as you are able, and I'll work through these issues with you.

## Agenda
1. Introduction to OpenRefine
    - About
    - Extensions
    - GLAM Metadata & LOD in OpenRefine
    - Resources

2. Import Data
    - CSV, Google Sheets
    - JSON, XML
    - API or OAI-PMH Data (taken from SHARE Examples)
    - RDF/XML, RDF Ntriples
3. Data Remediation/Munging
    - Splitting & Merging Columns, Rows
    - Faceting, Clustering
    - GREL for Text, Numbers, Dates
    - Regular Expressions
    - Example: Date Formats; Personal Names;
4. Reconciliation
    - Add a column/hit APIs
    - Standard Reconciliation Services
    - Geonames, LCNAF, LCSH Reconciliation
    - Capturing URIs or Identifiers
5. Publishing your Normalized / Enhanced Metadata
    - What data representation and format do you need out?
    - Publishing CSV, JSON, XML for reloading or overlay into your system
    - Sharing full OpenRefine projects containing your data.
6. Questions, Possible Breakouts/New Directions
    - Reconciliation without OpenRefine
    - Building LDF Server for OpenRefine recon
    - Building Recon Services

## Working with Examples
By the end, we won't have *perfect* or *complete* remediated metadata files, but we'll know how to get there and have started on this work. I will have metadata taken from the SHARE API to work with, but also invite participants to bring their own metadata files or datasets to work on.
